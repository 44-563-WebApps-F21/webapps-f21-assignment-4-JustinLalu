        <p class="speech lordgoring">No.  I felt that I had fought the century with its own weapons, and won.</p>

        <h5 class="name">LORD GORING.</h5>  
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Sadly_.]</p>
        <p class="speech lordgoring">You thought you had won.</p>

        <h5 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5> 
        <p class="speech sirrobert">I thought so.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_After a long pause_.]</p>
        <p class="speech sirrobert">Arthur, do you despise me for what I have told you?</p>

        <h5 class="name">LORD GORING.</h5>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_With deep feeling in his voice_.]</p>
        <p class="speech lordgoring">I am very sorry for you, Robert, very sorry indeed.</p>

        <h5 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5> 
        <p class="speech sirrobert">I don’t say that I suffered any remorse.  I didn’t.
        Not remorse in the ordinary, rather silly sense of the word.  But I have
        paid conscience money many times.  I had a wild hope that I might disarm
        destiny.  The sum Baron Arnheim gave me I have distributed twice over in
        public charities since then.</p>

        <h5 class="name">LORD GORING.</h5>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Looking up_.]</p>
        <p class="speech lordgoring">In public charities?  Dear me! what a lot of harm you must have done, Robert!</p>

        <h5 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h5>
        <p class="speech sirrobert">Oh, don’t say that, Arthur; don’t talk like that!</p>
