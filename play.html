            LORD GORING.  Fortunately for them, if one is to judge by results.  But
            tell me definitely, how did the Baron finally persuade you to—well, to do
            what you did?

            SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  When I was going away he said to me that if I ever
            could give him any private information of real value he would make me a
            very rich man.  I was dazed at the prospect he held out to me, and my
            ambition and my desire for power were at that time boundless.  Six weeks
            later certain private documents passed through my hands.

            LORD GORING.  [_Keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the carpet_.]  State
            documents?

            SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes.  [LORD GORING _sighs_, _then passes his hand
            across his forehead and looks up_.]

            LORD GORING.  I had no idea that you, of all men in the world, could have
            been so weak, Robert, as to yield to such a temptation as Baron Arnheim
            held out to you.

            SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Weak?  Oh, I am sick of hearing that phrase.  Sick
            of using it about others.  Weak?  Do you really think, Arthur, that it is
            weakness that yields to temptation?  I tell you that there are terrible
            temptations that it requires strength, strength and courage, to yield to.
            To stake all one’s life on a single moment, to risk everything on one
            throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care not—there is no
            weakness in that.  There is a horrible, a terrible courage.  I had that
            courage.  I sat down the same afternoon and wrote Baron Arnheim the
            letter this woman now holds.  He made three-quarters of a million over
            the transaction.

            LORD GORING.  And you?

            SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I received from the Baron £110,000.

            LORD GORING.  You were worth more, Robert.
